# Psychic-Game
1. In this game I am looking to have the user guess the letter by using their keyboards
2. The user will have 9 guesses to guess the letter right 
3. If the user guesses the letter right, they win
4. If the user do not guess the letter right they lose 
5. On the page the user will see how many guesses they have left
6.  The user will also see how many wins and losses they have
